## 1. Introduction of MEasy HMI 2.0 framework

---

MEasy HMI 2.0 is a set of QT5 based human-machine interface framework developed by Shenzhen Mir Technology Co., Ltd. The project uses QML and C ++ mixed programming, uses QML to efficiently and conveniently build the UI, and C ++ is used to implement business logic and complex algorithms. According to the type of application, we divide the entire UI into five categories: multimedia, smart appliances, health care, public services, and systems. Each class contains different subclasses, and we have implemented corresponding applications for each subclass. As shown in Figure 1-1
