### 4.1 Integrated MEasy HMI 2.0 application on the AM335X series development board

MEasy HMI 2.0 running on the MYD-C335X-GW development board needs to contain mxapp2 application program, QT5 runtime library, eglfs library, font files, audio and video and picture and other resource files. These resource files are eventually integrated into a file system by Buildoot. Buildroot contains pre-stored files provided by MYIR and files generated by Buildroot compilation.

The files provided by MYIR are placed under the `myir-buildroot/board/myir/common/HMI2.0` directory.

```

The above files will be copied to the target file system by buildroot executing the `myir-buildroot/board/myir/myd_c335x_gw/post-build.sh` script during the compilation process.

```
...
if grep -Eq "^BR2_PACKAGE_MEASY_HMI2.0=y$" ${BR2_CONFIG}; then
    echo "\"include measy_hmi\""
	cp -a board/myir/common/HMI2/*  output/target
else
    echo "\" not include measy_hmi2.0\""
fi
...
```

The files generated by buildroot are configured in myd_c335x_gw_hmi2.0_defconfig, and after the compilation is completed, enter the `myir-buildroot/output/target` directory. Finally, buildroot generates various file systems according to the configuration located in the `myir-buildroot/output/images` directory.

Execute the following two lines of commands in the buildroot directory to complete the compilation of the target board running MEasy HMI 2.0 file system.
```
make myd_c335x_gw_hmi2.0_defconfig
make
```

The first compilation is time-consuming. After the compilation is completed, refer to Chapter 6 of _MYD-C335X-GW Linux 4.14.67.pdf Development Manual_.
