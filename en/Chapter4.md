## 4 MEasy HMI 2.0 Application Integration

---
In the previous chapter we introduced how to build the runtime environment, compilation environment, and development process of MEasy HMI 2.0. This chapter will focus on how to integrate the MEasy HMI 2.0 application into the target board system so that it can be started after booting.

The AM335X series development board uses Buildroot to generate the file system. The i.MX6UL series development board and the STM32MP157 series development board use Yocto to generate the file system. About MEasy HMI 2.0 application integration reference corresponding chapter.
