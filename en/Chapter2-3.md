### 2.3 Health Care

This chapter demonstrates how to use the electrocardiograph application in the health care of MEasy HMI 2.0 to draw ECG waveforms, dynamic display of ECG, NIBP, SPO2, RESP, TEMP and other parameters.

**Software Environment：**

* ECG application

**Hardware Environment：**

* A MYIR development board supporting MEasy HMI 2.0.




**UI Description：**

{% raw %}
<div  align="center" >
<img src="/imagech/2-3-1.png",alt="cover", width=480 >
</div>
<div align="center" > Figure 2-3-1 ECG interface </div>
<p></p>
{% endraw %}

* The left side of the interface is the dynamic drawing area of ECG waveform.
* The right side of the interface is the dynamic display area of ECG, NIBP, SPO2, RESP, TEMP and other data.

**Test steps:**

* Click the  ECG App on the main interface to enter the ECG interface.
* The ECG waveform on the left side of the interface will be drawn dynamically.
* The ECG, NIBP, SPO2, RESP, TEMP and other data on the right side of the interface are refreshed every second.
* Click the exit button in the upper right corner to exit the electrocardiograph application.
